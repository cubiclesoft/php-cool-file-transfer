Cool File Transfer
==================

Directly transfer files between two devices using nothing more than a web browser and a standard PHP enabled web server.  Choose from a MIT or LGPL license.

Instead of using third-party services such as Dropbox or Google Drive to transfer files, Cool File Transfer directly transfers files through a host that both devices have access to.  It's great for moving large files without requiring intermediate storage!

Your PC, tablet, smartphone, refridgerator, and IT department thank you for choosing Cool File Transfer.
